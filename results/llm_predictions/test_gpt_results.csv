The presence of exercise-induced angina (exang = 1) and a flat ST segment slope (slope = 1) are additional indicators of potential cardiac issues. The ST-T abnormality on the resting ECG (restecg = 1) and the presence of two major vessels with fluoroscopy findings (ca = 2) further suggest underlying coronary artery disease.","PREDICTION: Yes
