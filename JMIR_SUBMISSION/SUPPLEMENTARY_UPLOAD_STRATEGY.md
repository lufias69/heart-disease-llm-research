# JMIR SUBMISSION - SUPPLEMENTARY FILES STRATEGY

## RECOMMENDED: Upload Supplementary as Separate Files

Since embedding figures into DOCX requires manual work or additional libraries, the cleaner approach for JMIR is to upload supplementary materials as separate, properly labeled files.

## 📂 Files to Upload:

### Main Manuscript Section:
1. **JMIR_MANUSCRIPT.docx** → Main Document

### Main Figures Section (Upload Separately):
2. **Figure_1_Consistency_Patterns.png** 
   - From: JAMIA_SUBMISSION/Figures/Figure1.png
   - Label: "Figure 1"

3. **Figure_2_Confusion_Matrices.png**
   - From: JAMIA_SUBMISSION/Figures/Figure2.png
   - Label: "Figure 2"

4. **Figure_3_Prompt_Sensitivity.png**
   - From: JAMIA_SUBMISSION/Figures/Figure3.png
   - Label: "Figure 3"

### Supplementary Files Section:
5. **Multimedia_Appendix_1_Tables.docx**
   - Contains: All supplementary tables S1-S5
   - Label: "Multimedia Appendix 1 - Tables"

6. **Supplementary_Figure_S1.png**
   - From: JAMIA_SUBMISSION/Supplementary/FigureS1.png
   - Label: "Supplementary Figure S1 - ROC Curves"

7. **Supplementary_Figure_S2.png**
   - From: JAMIA_SUBMISSION/Supplementary/FigureS2.png
   - Label: "Supplementary Figure S2 - Distributions"

8. **Supplementary_Figure_S3.png**
   - From: JAMIA_SUBMISSION/Supplementary/FigureS3.png
   - Label: "Supplementary Figure S3 - Feature Correlations"

9. **Supplementary_Figure_S4.png**
   - From: JAMIA_SUBMISSION/Supplementary/FigureS4.png
   - Label: "Supplementary Figure S4 - Consistency Distributions"

10. **Supplementary_Figure_S5.png**
    - From: JAMIA_SUBMISSION/Supplementary/FigureS5.png
    - Label: "Supplementary Figure S5 - Model Comparison"

11. **Supplementary_Figure_S6.png**
    - From: JAMIA_SUBMISSION/Supplementary/FigureS6.png
    - Label: "Supplementary Figure S6 - Threshold Optimization"

## ✅ Total Files: 11

- 1 main manuscript
- 3 main figures
- 1 supplementary tables document
- 6 supplementary figures

---

## 📋 Upload Order in JMIR ScholarOne:

1. **Step "Upload Manuscript":**
   - Upload: JMIR_MANUSCRIPT.docx
   - Designation: "Main Document"

2. **Step "Upload Figures":**
   - Upload Figure 1-3 (PNG files)
   - Designation: "Figure" (auto-numbered)

3. **Step "Upload Supplementary Files":**
   - Upload Multimedia Appendix 1 (DOCX with tables)
   - Upload Supplementary Figures S1-S6 (PNG files)
   - Designation: "Supplementary File"

---

## 💡 Advantages of This Approach:

✅ No manual embedding needed
✅ High-resolution figures preserved
✅ Easier for reviewers to zoom/examine figures
✅ Standard JMIR format
✅ Easy to update individual files during revision

---

## 🚨 File Naming Convention (JMIR Recommended):

When uploading, JMIR system will ask for file designation. Use these:

**Main Figures:**
- Figure_1.png → "Figure 1"
- Figure_2.png → "Figure 2"  
- Figure_3.png → "Figure 3"

**Supplementary:**
- Multimedia_Appendix_1.docx → "Multimedia Appendix 1"
- Supplementary_Figure_S1.png → "Supplementary Figure 1"
- Supplementary_Figure_S2.png → "Supplementary Figure 2"
- ... (continue S3-S6)

System will auto-generate proper citations in final published version.

**READY TO USE THIS APPROACH?**

All source files are already in place:
- Main: JMIR_SUBMISSION/JMIR_MANUSCRIPT.docx ✅
- Figures: JAMIA_SUBMISSION/Figures/ ✅
- Supp Tables: JMIR_SUBMISSION/MULTIMEDIA_APPENDIX_1.docx ✅
- Supp Figures: JAMIA_SUBMISSION/Supplementary/ ✅

Just upload them separately during JMIR submission process!
