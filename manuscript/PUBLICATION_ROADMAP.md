## 📝 NOTES & DECISIONS

### Key Decisions Made:
1. ✅ **Journal Selection:** JAMIA (free, IF 6.5, perfect scope)
2. ✅ **Preprint Strategy:** Upload to medRxiv before JAMIA submission
3. ✅ **Manuscript Version:** JAMIA trimmed version (4,900 words)
4. ✅ **Timing:** Submit Jan 2-10 to avoid holiday delays

### Open Decisions:
1. ⏳ **Article Type:** Research & Applications (4,000 limit) vs Review (4,000 limit)
   - Current: 4,900 words (need to trim 900 or change type)
   - Decision needed by: Jan 2, 2026
2. ⏳ **Open Access:** FREE at JAMIA, but need to confirm
   - Decision needed by: Upon acceptance
3. ⏳ **Co-authors:** TBD (are there co-authors?)
   - Decision needed by: Dec 15, 2025

### Risks & Contingencies:
- **Risk 1:** Word count over limit (4,900 vs 4,000)
  - **Contingency:** Trim Discussion by 900 words OR submit as "Review" type
- **Risk 2:** Reviewer requests comparison with human physicians
  - **Contingency:** Cite as limitation, propose as future work
- **Risk 3:** Reviewer questions dataset age (1988)
  - **Contingency:** Emphasize findings about LLM behavior, not clinical validation
