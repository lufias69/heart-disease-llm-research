Subject: Re: Manuscript Transfer Decision - amiajnl-2025-018821

Dear Dr. Suzanne Bakken,

Thank you for your consideration of our manuscript amiajnl-2025-018821 titled "High Consistency, Limited Accuracy: Evaluating Large Language Models for Binary Medical Diagnosis" and for the opportunity to transfer it to JAMIA Open.

While we appreciate the offer and recognize JAMIA Open as a reputable publication venue, we must respectfully DECLINE the transfer at this time due to budget constraints related to article processing charges. As researchers from a developing country institution without dedicated publication funding, we are currently unable to cover open access fees.

We are grateful for your time in reviewing our work and for the constructive feedback regarding methodological innovation priorities at JAMIA. This guidance will be valuable as we consider alternative venues that align better with our study's comparative evaluation approach.

We remain interested in contributing to JAMIA in the future and will keep your editorial priorities in mind for our ongoing research on methodological innovations in clinical AI.

Thank you again for your professional handling of our submission.

Yours sincerely,

Dr. Syaiful Bachri Mustamin
