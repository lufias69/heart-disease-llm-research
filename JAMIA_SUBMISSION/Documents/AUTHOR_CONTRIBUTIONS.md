## Collective Statements

**All authors:**
- Have approved the final version of the manuscript
- Agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work
- Ensure accuracy and integrity of the research
- Have read and approved the submission to JAMIA

**Manuscript Preparation:**  
The manuscript was primarily written by S.B.M. with input and review from all co-authors. All authors contributed to the interpretation of results and approved the final conclusions.

**Data Access:**  
S.B.M. had full access to all data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and accuracy of the data analysis.



## AI and Technology Disclosure

**AI Systems as Research Subjects:**  
This study evaluated three large language models as research subjects:
- OpenAI GPT-4o API (evaluated for diagnostic performance)
- Google Gemini-2.0-Flash API (evaluated for diagnostic performance)
- Alibaba Qwen-Plus API (evaluated for diagnostic performance)

These AI systems were used solely to generate diagnostic predictions that served as research data. The models were not used for manuscript writing, data analysis, literature review, or interpretation of results.

**Data Analysis and Code:**  
All statistical analysis, data visualization, and research code were developed by S.B.M. using Python programming language with standard scientific libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib). No AI code generation tools were used.

**Manuscript Preparation:**  
The manuscript text, including all sections (introduction, methods, results, discussion, conclusions), was written entirely by human authors without generative AI writing assistance. No AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or similar) were used to draft, edit, or revise any manuscript content.

**Literature Search:**  
Literature review and reference management were conducted by human authors using traditional academic databases and tools.
