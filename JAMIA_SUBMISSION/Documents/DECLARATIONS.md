## Ethics Approval

**Ethics Review Status:** Not Required

**Justification:**  
This study utilized the publicly available, de-identified UCI Heart Disease Dataset, which contains no personally identifiable information. The research involved:
1. Secondary analysis of existing public data (no human subjects)
2. Evaluation of AI systems (no patient interaction)
3. No collection of new patient data
4. No clinical interventions

**Regulatory Compliance:**  
- UCI Heart Disease Dataset is licensed under CC BY 4.0 for research use
- Dataset was originally collected with appropriate ethics approval in 1988
- Our secondary analysis complies with institutional research policies

**Institutional Review Board (IRB):**  
Formal IRB approval was not required as no human subjects research was conducted. This determination is consistent with regulations governing secondary analysis of public, de-identified datasets.



## Informed Consent

**Status:** Not Applicable

**Justification:**  
No human subjects participated in this research. The study analyzed:
1. Pre-existing public dataset (UCI Heart Disease, 1988)
2. AI model outputs (not human participants)
3. No new patient recruitment or data collection



## Data Protection and Privacy

**Compliance:**  
- No personal or identifiable patient data was used
- All data is publicly available and de-identified
- Research complies with GDPR and international data protection standards
- No additional privacy considerations were required

## Acknowledgments

**API Providers:**  
We acknowledge OpenAI, Google, and Alibaba Cloud for providing API access to GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and Qwen-Plus respectively. API access was obtained through standard commercial services without sponsorship or preferential treatment.

**Data Source:**  
We thank the UCI Machine Learning Repository and the original data collectors (Janosi, Steinbrunn, Pfisterer, and Detrano) for making the Heart Disease dataset publicly available.

**Technical Support:**  
No external technical, writing, or editorial support was provided.

**No Conflicts:**  
These acknowledgments do not constitute conflicts of interest, as no financial or material support was provided beyond standard commercial API services paid at market rates.

## Generative AI and Technology Disclosure

**AI as Research Subject:**  
This study evaluates three large language models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash, Qwen-Plus) as research subjects for medical diagnostic assessment. These AI systems were used solely to generate diagnostic predictions that served as study data for analysis. The AI models were accessed via their respective commercial APIs (OpenAI, Google, Alibaba Cloud) under standard terms of service.

**Manuscript Preparation:**  
The manuscript text, including introduction, methods, results, discussion, and conclusions, was written entirely by human authors without generative AI writing assistance. No AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or similar) were used to draft, edit, or revise any portion of the manuscript text.

**Data Analysis and Code:**  
All data analysis, statistical computations, and visualizations were performed by human authors using Python programming. Standard scientific libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib) were used for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and plotting. All analysis code was written by human authors without AI code generation assistance.

**Literature Search and Citations:**  
Literature search and reference management were conducted by human authors using traditional academic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar) and reference management software. No AI tools were used for literature review or citation generation.

**Transparency Commitment:**  
All interactions with the evaluated AI systems (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash, Qwen-Plus) are fully documented in the publicly available research repository, including exact prompts used, API parameters, and complete prediction datasets. This ensures full reproducibility and transparency of the research methodology.
