Subject: Urgent: Withdrawal Request - Manuscript Transferred from JAMIA (amiajnl-2025-018821)

Dear JAMIA Open Editorial Office,

I am writing to formally request the withdrawal of a manuscript that was recently transferred from JAMIA to JAMIA Open.

**Manuscript Details:**
- Original JAMIA ID: amiajnl-2025-018821
- Title: "High Consistency, Limited Accuracy: Evaluating Large Language Models for Binary Medical Diagnosis"
- Authors: Anggriani D, Mustamin SB, Atnang M, Nuzry KAP
- Transfer approved: [DATE when you clicked approve]

**Reason for Withdrawal:**
Upon further review of JAMIA Open's article processing charges, I realized that our research institution does not have funding to cover open access publication fees. As researchers from a developing country institution (Indonesia) without dedicated research grants, we are unable to proceed with the publication in JAMIA Open at this time.

I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding of our financial constraints. I should have carefully reviewed the APC policy before approving the transfer.

**Request:**
Please confirm withdrawal of this manuscript before formal peer review begins, allowing us to seek alternative publication venues that align with our budget limitations.

We remain interested in contributing to JAMIA Open in the future when appropriate funding becomes available.

Thank you for your professional consideration.

Yours sincerely,

Dr. Syaiful Bachri Mustamin
